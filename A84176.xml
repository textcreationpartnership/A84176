         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y Reaſon of your Sufferings, I am much ſadded, eſpecially to conſider, that good men ſhould ſtill be ſubject to the Tyranny of the late
High-Commiſſion Promoters, and Informers, the <hi>Stationers,</hi> through whoſe malice, both You and your Servants are thus Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Wee have known and obſerved them a long time, how they have been a naughty and vexatious people to all Good Men, as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
as any <hi>Pattentees</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> In the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> times, they were like <hi>Setting-Dogges,</hi> to hunt Good Men and Women into the
<hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> Netts; and wee ſee, it is to little purpoſe to put downe thoſe Courts, and not Puniſh thoſe wicked
men; for they hate all that are honeſt in their hearts, becauſe they that are honeſt, are againſt their Patent: and therefore they ſtuddy night and day:
how to undoe them, and are like <hi>Mothes</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> creeping into imployment, upon pretext of doing great ſervice, but indeed, being corrupt
themſelves, endeavour to make others ſo too, and miſlead them that give care to them, into ſuch courſes, as will in time make them odious to the:
World, ſo true it is, <hi>that thoſe that touch Pitch, ſhall be defiled therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch as they have been, ſuch they continue, for without doubt, they are the principall cauſe why this inhumaine courſe of examining men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Intergatories</hi> is continued, eſpecially in criminall cauſes, notwithſtanding it hath been ſo cryed out upon by <hi>Parliaments,</hi> by <hi>Martyrs, Miniſters,</hi>
and all true Chriſtian <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as a thing againſt the Lawes of God, of Nature, Nations, and of this Kingdome, (as was faithfully pleaded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day in Colonell <hi>Lilburns</hi> caſe, at the Lords Barre,) in which Caſe, and likewiſe in another of greater moment, about a Petition rejected by
their Lordſhips, their Lordſhips have dealt ſo Nobly, and Worthily, as hath put their Honours paſt all hurt or blemiſh, from ſuch Paper-pellets,
as have unhappily occaſioned your ſufferings: And if all other Parties, intimated in that Paper, <hi>(Londons laſt Warning,)</hi> prove when they are tryed,
as their Lordſhips have done, the Author will have cauſe to repent his too haſty Zeal. And certainly their Honours had paſt it over, and had not
inſiſted thus upon you, but upon the <hi>Stationers</hi> inſtigation, and misinformation; and will not perſiſt to examine Free Commoners, <hi>ex Officio,</hi> nor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
againſt their Maſters, againſt their Wills: all ſorts of People, great and ſmall, ought to <hi>doe as they would be done by;</hi> and God by his Providence
faileth not firſt or laſt, to render meaſure for meaſure; Therefore I hope, their Lordſhips will give eare no longer to the malitious ſuggeſtions, and
inſinuations of wicked men, but upon conſideration of your faithfulneſſe to the Parliament, the affliction of your Wife, and family; and
that a ſmall time of impriſonment may undoe you and them, they will not retaine you longer, but ſet you free, and look upon the <hi>Stationers,</hi>
as Cankers of the Common-wealth, and deſtructive to all true Honour.</p>
            <p>However, you doe well to ſtand in the <hi>Liberty, wherein God, and the Law of the Land hath made you free,</hi> and not to be intangled with any yoake of
bondage; the greateſt whereof, is for a man to be bound <hi>to Accuſe himſelf, or another:</hi> and next thereunto, is to be enforced, <hi>to be Tryed otherwiſe then
by his Peers or Equalls,</hi> in both which, you have carried your ſelf like a true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> chuſing rather to ſuffer impriſonment, and great affliction,
then betray your native Liberties, and the Liberties of your Country, for which, all good People will ever love and reſpect you, and all others, who
have done, or ſhall doe, as you have done herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> is the firſt we read of, that endeavoured this cruell diſtorting of the mind, ſaying to our Bleſſed Saviour; <hi>I charge thee: by the Everlaſting God,
tell us who thou art;</hi> a bad Preſident for Chriſtians to follow: and ſtrange it is, it ſhould be owned by any but <hi>Star-Chamber, High-Commiſſion,</hi> or
<hi>Pattentee-Chriſtians,</hi> farre be it from any that would truely deſerve that holy Name, to owne ſo unholy a practiſe, and if any favour thereof, be to be
found in any of our Legall Tryalls, though it be but to Anſwr <hi>Guilty, or not Guilty,</hi> as it came, and crept in by Tyranny, (for thoſe who know the
Truth, know it to be ſo,) ſo ought it to be totally excluded by thoſe, who would be eſteemed true Chriſtian Law-makers, or Reformers.</p>
            <p>The Lords, by the inſtigation of the <hi>Stationers,</hi> have taken offence againſt you, wherein themſelves are Partees, and if there were no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
it is moſt unequall, they ſhould be your Judges: But the Law of the Land is expreſſe, <hi>That you a Commoner, are not to be adjudged of Life, Limbe
or Liberty, but by Commoners, who are your Peers, and that upon ſufficient Teſtimony of honeſt and faithfull Witneſſes, face to face, in open Court.</hi> Friend, you
are upon a ſure ground, for theſe things are ſo eſſentiall, to the <hi>Freedom of the People,</hi> as <hi>Parliaments</hi> will never alter them; nor I hope, act contrary
to them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, however the <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament, have (upon miſ-information,) delivered you up to the Lords, to be tryed by them,
yet may they as well transferre all the Power they are intruſted with, by the generality of all the <hi>Commoners of England,</hi> and referre the whole
Government, to the ſole diſpoſing of the Lords. And indeed, they have done little leſſe in this act, then delivered us all up to the Lords, for there
is the ſame equity for their trying and Impriſoning mee, and ſo of every man, as for their trying and impriſoning you; So that your caſe in this
particular, <hi>Is every mans Caſe,</hi> though generally, men are ſo ſottiſh, as to be ſenſible of the laſh, then, only when it falls upon their own backs, not
conſidering, That they may ſuffer to morrow that miſery and calamity, which to day their Brother groanes under. I hope therefore, upon better
conſideration, the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> will take you to their own Protection, and deal with you, as is juſtly due to every <hi>Commoner,</hi> and not hold
you in Priſon, unleſſe by faithfull and credible Witneſſes, they find by the Law of the Land, you are guilty of a crime deſerving the ſame.</p>
            <p>And that moſt be no ſmall one, for beleeve it, our Fore-fathers eſteemed Impriſonment no ſmall Puniſhment. Frequent Impriſonment, is an effect
of exorbitant Power, by which, ſooner then by any other meanes, plain and mean People are brought to ſtoop to the Wills of the Mighty: it being
the way to deſtroy them, their Wives, and Families, by keeping them from their trades, husbandry, and other Callings: and hath ſerved more then
any one thing to breake the Spirits of the people: being a ſubtill politick puniſhment, that makes, and keepes men tame, and fit for ſlavery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all other puniſhments, if injurious, makes people wilde, and therefore this hath been practiſed by thoſe that have moſt encroached upon the
Liberties of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as will appeare by Proceedings of foarty or threeſcore yeeres laſt paſt in Court, City, and all Countries, every trifle hath
been ſufficient to procure an Impriſonment, and the Land groaneth under this intollerable burden ſtill. But of all other Teſtimonies of our Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<hi>Cloſe Impriſonment</hi> is the moſt manifeſt: where a man ſhall be kept from the ſight of his Friends, and Comforters in his bonds, and in a gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehenſion of he knows not what miſchief may befall him, as hath formerly happened to divers great men, (that might be inſtanced in,) by
meanes of the advantage wicked men have taken from the opportunity of ſafely doing miſchiefe to a <hi>Cloſe Priſoner.</hi> Next to the Rack, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
certainly this is the moſt unchriſtian, unmanly, and irrationall uſage of <hi>Free-men,</hi> and will we hope, in this time of Reformation; be utterly
baniſhed out of this Land: Never had Parliament ſuch an opportunity as this hath; Nor are we to doubt, but they will performe the ſame: and I
ſhould be glad to ſee ſome fruit thereof in their bearing towards you. And that they would look back upon the Stationers (and all other Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers,)
and remember them, when they ſhall make ſuit to have the Printing of the Bible, or for other favours, that they have dealt treacherouſly
with the Parliament, and have miniſtred occaſion of much trouble and vexation to them, and many of their moſt faithfull Friends, being as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi>
were to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their Paſſage from <hi>Egyptian bondage,</hi> to the Freedome of <hi>Canaan.</hi> God, I truſt, will at length remember them, and
will alſo, I truſt, deliver you out of the power of their malice, and recompence you a hundred fold for theſe your Sufferings. The <hi>Commons</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
have a right in you, which they cannot diſclaime, other Judges you have not; it is moſt unequall you ſhould have other, as I could in few
lines demonſtrate, paſt all deniall; but I will not doe it now, and I hope, I ſhall not have further occaſion to viſite you in this kind; I doe not deſire
it; I heartily wiſh you at home with your Family, as knowing a little longer impriſonment, may prove your utter overthrow: which would very
much afflict the Spirits of your faithfull Friends, and would not be for the honour or profit of any. <hi>However, comfort your ſelf in GOD, and be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
hee will never leave you, nor forſake you; And when the memories of thoſe Officious men, that ſollicite againſt you, ſhall be odious to all good men; you will be
remembred, as one that knew and maintained the juſt Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>and ſhrunke not in time of Tryall.</hi>
